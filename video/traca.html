<h1>o voo da traça morta</h1>
<h2>video, 247'46 (2020)</h2>
<p>A moth makes its last flight, looking for a place to die.<br>This allegorical trip was represented in a audiovisual piece 
with the duration of the gallery's daily opening hours.<br> Every day, the piece played once and only fragments of it were seen, 
never its totality.<br> The video begins with a lot of distortion and noise which slowly softens along its 4 hour duration, transforming into different 
landscapes and melodies, ending with the final place chosen by the moth.</p>
