<h1>hugo januário</h1>
<p style="width:45%;">
Born in March 4th 1992 and based in Lisbon. 
Started college by studying architecture and eventually changed to a multimedia art course in Faculdade de Belas-Artes de Lisboa, 
having finished it in 2019. Currently doing a post-graduation in Sound Art.<br><br> 
I work mostly through video and performance, focusing on themes such as memories and change, often associated with abandoned places and architectural space.
