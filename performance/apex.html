<h2>live performance (2019)</h2>
<p>An instruction piece is given to the performers.<br>
 For one hour, they must act on it, while on stage, stimulated by the gradual, intense and climatic sound and light effects.<br>
 The performance is not in any way rehearsed, given the fact that the performers have no prior access to the lights or sounds,<br>
 performing completely oblivious and instinctively. The final piece will be determined the day the performance happens.<br>
 The sound and light was created by three people. They have no power over the actual performance, and no clue of what is going to happen.
<br>
<br>
<u>INSTRUCTION PIECE</u>
<br>
In 60 minutes, reach a climax using the material on stage to build a tall construction. The action does not end until you are satisfied with it.
