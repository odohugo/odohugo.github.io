<h1>metamorfose + uns minutos com o meu avô</h1>
<h2>live performance with video (2019)</h2>

<p>
 Sitting at a table, an eraser was used from beginning to end, worn down to small pieces on a piece of cardboard.<br>
 While this action occurred, the video <i>Uns minutos com o meu avô</i> was shown on one of the room's walls.<br>
 In that video, I am sitting at a table, listening to a song that reminds me of my late grandfather and thinking of moments we spent together.<br>
 The music repeatedly alternates between playing at normal volume and playing almost no sound, making it is possible to hear children playing in the background.<br>
 The performance ended when the eraser was fully worn out.
